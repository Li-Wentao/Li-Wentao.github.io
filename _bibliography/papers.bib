    abstract = "{Our primary objective is to provide the clinical informatics community with an introductory tutorial on calibration measurements and calibration models for predictive models using existing R packages and custom implemented code in R on real and simulated data. Clinical predictive model performance is commonly published based on discrimination measures, but use of models for individualized predictions requires adequate model calibration. This tutorial is intended for clinical researchers who want to evaluate predictive models in terms of their applicability to a particular population. It is also for informaticians and for software engineers who want to understand the role that calibration plays in the evaluation of a clinical predictive model, and to provide them with a solid starting point to consider incorporating calibration evaluation and calibration models in their work.Covered topics include (1) an introduction to the importance of calibration in the clinical setting, (2) an illustration of the distinct roles that discrimination and calibration play in the assessment of clinical predictive models, (3) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration measurements, (4) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration models, and (5) a brief discussion of limitations of these methods and practical suggestions on how to use them in practice.}",

	abstract = {Summary As DNA sequencing data is available for personal use, genomic privacy is becoming a major challenge. Nevertheless, high-throughput genomic data analysis outsourcing is performed using pipelines that tend to overlook these challenges.Results We present a client-server-based outsourcing framework for genotype imputation, an important step in genomic data analyses. Genotype data is encrypted by the client and encrypted data are used by the server that never observes the data in plain. Cloud-based framework can benefit from virtually unlimited computational resources while providing provable confidentiality. We demonstrate server{\textquoteright}s utility from several aspects using genotype dataset from the 1000 Genomes datasets. First, we benchmark the accuracy of common variant imputation in comparison to BEAGLE, a state-of-the-art imputation method. We also provide the detailed time requirements of the server to showcase scaling of time usage in different steps of imputation. We also present a simple correlation metric that can be used to estimate imputation accuracy using only the reference panels. This is important for filtering the variants in downstream analyses. As a further demonstration and a different use case, we performed a simulated genomewide association study (GWAS) using imputed and known genotypes and highlight potential utility of the server for association studies. Overall, our study present multiple lines of evidence for usability of secure imputation service.Availability Server is publicly available at https://www.secureomics.org/OpenImpute. Users can anonymously test and use imputation server without registration.Contact Arif.O.Harmanci{at}uth.tmc.eduCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Generalized Linear Mixed Model is one of the most pervasive class of statistical models. It is widely used in the medical domain. Training such models in a collaborative setting often entails privacy risks. Standard privacy preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy can be used to mitigate the privacy risk during training the model. However, experimental evidence suggests that adding differential privacy to the training of the model can cause significant utility loss which makes the model impractical for real world usage. Therefore, it becomes clear that the specific class of generalized linear mixed models which lose their usability under differential privacy requires a different approach for privacy preserving model training. In this work, we propose a value-blind training method in a collaborative setting for generalized linear mixed models. In our proposed training method, the central server optimizes model parameters for a generalized linear mixed model without ever getting access to the raw training data or intermediate computation values. Intermediate computation values that are shared by the collaborating parties with the central server are encrypted using homomorphic encryption. Experimentation on multiple datasets suggests that the model trained by our proposed method achieves very low error rate while preserving privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic privacy analysis of generalized linear mixed model training in collaborative setting.}

As the awareness of individual and group genomic privacy is growing, privacy-preserving methods for the estimation of relatedness are needed. Presented methods alleviate the ethical and privacy concerns in the analysis of relatedness in admixed, historically isolated and underrepresented populations.Genetic relatedness is a central quantity used for finding relatives in databases, correcting biases in genome wide association studies and for estimating population-level statistics. Methods for estimating genetic relatedness have high computational requirements, and occasionally do not consider individuals from admixed ancestries. Furthermore, the ethical concerns around using genetic data and calculating relatedness are not considered. We present a projection-based approach that can efficiently and accurately estimate kinship. We implement our method using encryption-based techniques that provide provable security guarantees to protect genetic data while kinship statistics are computed among multiple sites.}",
