    abstract = "{Our primary objective is to provide the clinical informatics community with an introductory tutorial on calibration measurements and calibration models for predictive models using existing R packages and custom implemented code in R on real and simulated data. Clinical predictive model performance is commonly published based on discrimination measures, but use of models for individualized predictions requires adequate model calibration. This tutorial is intended for clinical researchers who want to evaluate predictive models in terms of their applicability to a particular population. It is also for informaticians and for software engineers who want to understand the role that calibration plays in the evaluation of a clinical predictive model, and to provide them with a solid starting point to consider incorporating calibration evaluation and calibration models in their work.Covered topics include (1) an introduction to the importance of calibration in the clinical setting, (2) an illustration of the distinct roles that discrimination and calibration play in the assessment of clinical predictive models, (3) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration measurements, (4) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration models, and (5) a brief discussion of limitations of these methods and practical suggestions on how to use them in practice.}",

  abstract={With the reduction of sequencing costs and the pervasiveness of computing devices, genomic data collection is continually growing. However, data collection is highly fragmented and the data is still siloed across different repositories. Analyzing all of this data would be transformative for genomics research. However, the data is sensitive, and therefore cannot be easily centralized. Furthermore, there may be correlations in the data, which if not detected, can impact the analysis. In this paper, we take the first step towards identifying correlated records across multiple data repositories in a privacy-preserving manner. The proposed framework, based on random shuffling, synthetic record generation, and local differential privacy, allows a trade-off of accuracy and computational efficiency. An extensive evaluation on real genomic data from the OpenSNP dataset shows that the proposed solution is efficient and effective.},

	abstract = {Summary As DNA sequencing data is available for personal use, genomic privacy is becoming a major challenge. Nevertheless, high-throughput genomic data analysis outsourcing is performed using pipelines that tend to overlook these challenges.Results We present a client-server-based outsourcing framework for genotype imputation, an important step in genomic data analyses. Genotype data is encrypted by the client and encrypted data are used by the server that never observes the data in plain. Cloud-based framework can benefit from virtually unlimited computational resources while providing provable confidentiality. We demonstrate server{\textquoteright}s utility from several aspects using genotype dataset from the 1000 Genomes datasets. First, we benchmark the accuracy of common variant imputation in comparison to BEAGLE, a state-of-the-art imputation method. We also provide the detailed time requirements of the server to showcase scaling of time usage in different steps of imputation. We also present a simple correlation metric that can be used to estimate imputation accuracy using only the reference panels. This is important for filtering the variants in downstream analyses. As a further demonstration and a different use case, we performed a simulated genomewide association study (GWAS) using imputed and known genotypes and highlight potential utility of the server for association studies. Overall, our study present multiple lines of evidence for usability of secure imputation service.Availability Server is publicly available at https://www.secureomics.org/OpenImpute.

	abstract = {Generalized Linear Mixed Model is one of the most pervasive class of statistical models. It is widely used in the medical domain. Training such models in a collaborative setting often entails privacy risks. Standard privacy preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy can be used to mitigate the privacy risk during training the model. However, experimental evidence suggests that adding differential privacy to the training of the model can cause significant utility loss which makes the model impractical for real world usage. Therefore, it becomes clear that the specific class of generalized linear mixed models which lose their usability under differential privacy requires a different approach for privacy preserving model training. In this work, we propose a value-blind training method in a collaborative setting for generalized linear mixed models. In our proposed training method, the central server optimizes model parameters for a generalized linear mixed model without ever getting access to the raw training data or intermediate computation values. Intermediate computation values that are shared by the collaborating parties with the central server are encrypted using homomorphic encryption. Experimentation on multiple datasets suggests that the model trained by our proposed method achieves very low error rate while preserving privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic privacy analysis of generalized linear mixed model training in collaborative setting.}

Presented methods alleviate the ethical and privacy concerns in the analysis of relatedness in admixed, historically isolated and underrepresented populations.Genetic relatedness is a central quantity used for finding relatives in databases, correcting biases in genome wide association studies and for estimating population-level statistics. Methods for estimating genetic relatedness have high computational requirements, and occasionally do not consider individuals from admixed ancestries. Furthermore, the ethical concerns around using genetic data and calculating relatedness are not considered.

  abstract={Federated association testing is a powerful approach to conduct large-scale association studies where sites share intermediate statistics through a central server. There are, however, several standing challenges. Confounding factors like population stratiﬁcation should be carefully modeled across sites. In addition, it is crucial to consider disease etiology using ﬂexible models to prevent biases. Privacy protections for participants pose another signiﬁcant challenge. Here, we propose distributed Mixed Effects Genome-wide Association study (dMEGA), a method that enables federated generalized linear mixed model-based association testing across multiple sites without explicitly sharing genotype and phenotype data. dMEGA employs a reference projection to correct for population-stratiﬁcation and utilizes efﬁcient local-gradient updates among sites, incorporating both ﬁxed and random effects. The accuracy and efﬁciency of dMEGA are demonstrated through simulated and real datasets. dMEGA is publicly available at https://github.com/Li-Wentao/dMEGA.},
