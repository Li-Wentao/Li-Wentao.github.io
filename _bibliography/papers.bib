Clinical predictive model performance is commonly published based on discrimination measures, but use of models for individualized predictions requires adequate model calibration. This tutorial is intended for clinical researchers who want to evaluate predictive models in terms of their applicability to a particular population. It is also for informaticians and for software engineers who want to understand the role that calibration plays in the evaluation of a clinical predictive model, and to provide them with a solid starting point to consider incorporating calibration evaluation and calibration models in their work.Covered topics include (1) an introduction to the importance of calibration in the clinical setting, (2) an illustration of the distinct roles that discrimination and calibration play in the assessment of clinical predictive models, (3) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration measurements, (4) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration models, and (5) a brief discussion of limitations of these methods and practical suggestions on how to use them in practice.}",

  abstract={With the reduction of sequencing costs and the pervasiveness of computing devices, genomic data collection is continually growing. However, data collection is highly fragmented and the data is still siloed across different repositories. Analyzing all of this data would be transformative for genomics research. However, the data is sensitive, and therefore cannot be easily centralized. Furthermore, there may be correlations in the data, which if not detected, can impact the analysis. In this paper, we take the first step towards identifying correlated records across multiple data repositories in a privacy-preserving manner. The proposed framework, based on random shuffling, synthetic record generation, and local differential privacy, allows a trade-off of accuracy and computational efficiency. An extensive evaluation on real genomic data from the OpenSNP dataset shows that the proposed solution is efficient and effective.},

	abstract = {Summary As DNA sequencing data is available for personal use, genomic privacy is becoming a major challenge. Nevertheless, high-throughput genomic data analysis outsourcing is performed using pipelines that tend to overlook these challenges.Results We present a client-server-based outsourcing framework for genotype imputation, an important step in genomic data analyses. Genotype data is encrypted by the client and encrypted data are used by the server that never observes the data in plain. Cloud-based framework can benefit from virtually unlimited computational resources while providing provable confidentiality. We demonstrate server{\textquoteright}s utility from several aspects using genotype dataset from the 1000 Genomes datasets. First, we benchmark the accuracy of common variant imputation in comparison to BEAGLE, a state-of-the-art imputation method. We also provide the detailed time requirements of the server to showcase scaling of time usage in different steps of imputation. We also present a simple correlation metric that can be used to estimate imputation accuracy using only the reference panels. This is important for filtering the variants in downstream analyses. As a further demonstration and a different use case, we performed a simulated genomewide association study (GWAS) using imputed and known genotypes and highlight potential utility of the server for association studies. Overall, our study present multiple lines of evidence for usability of secure imputation service.Availability Server is publicly available at https://www.secureomics.org/OpenImpute.

	abstract = {Generalized Linear Mixed Model is one of the most pervasive class of statistical models. It is widely used in the medical domain. Training such models in a collaborative setting often entails privacy risks. Standard privacy preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy can be used to mitigate the privacy risk during training the model. However, experimental evidence suggests that adding differential privacy to the training of the model can cause significant utility loss which makes the model impractical for real world usage. Therefore, it becomes clear that the specific class of generalized linear mixed models which lose their usability under differential privacy requires a different approach for privacy preserving model training. In this work, we propose a value-blind training method in a collaborative setting for generalized linear mixed models. In our proposed training method, the central server optimizes model parameters for a generalized linear mixed model without ever getting access to the raw training data or intermediate computation values. Intermediate computation values that are shared by the collaborating parties with the central server are encrypted using homomorphic encryption. Experimentation on multiple datasets suggests that the model trained by our proposed method achieves very low error rate while preserving privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic privacy analysis of generalized linear mixed model training in collaborative setting.},

    abstract = "{Estimation of genetic relatedness, or kinship, is used occasionally for recreational purposes and in forensic applications. While numerous methods were developed to estimate kinship, they suffer from high computational requirements and often make an untenable assumption of homogeneous population ancestry of the samples. Moreover, genetic privacy is generally overlooked in the usage of kinship estimation methods. There can be ethical concerns about finding unknown familial relationships in third-party databases. Similar ethical concerns may arise while estimating and reporting sensitive population-level statistics such as inbreeding coefficients for the concerns around marginalization and stigmatization.Here, we present SIGFRIED, which makes use of existing reference panels with a projection-based approach that simplifies kinship estimation in the admixed populations. We use simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of kinship estimation. We present a secure federated kinship estimation framework and implement a secure kinship estimator using homomorphic encryption-based primitives for computing relatedness between samples in two different sites while genotype data are kept confidential. Source code and documentation for our methods can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7053352.Analysis of relatedness is fundamentally important for identifying relatives, in association studies, and for estimation of population-level estimates of inbreeding. As the awareness of individual and group genomic privacy is growing, privacy-preserving methods for the estimation of relatedness are needed. Presented methods alleviate the ethical and privacy concerns in the analysis of relatedness in admixed, historically isolated and underrepresented populations.Genetic relatedness is a central quantity used for finding relatives in databases, correcting biases in genome wide association studies and for estimating population-level statistics. Methods for estimating genetic relatedness have high computational requirements, and occasionally do not consider individuals from admixed ancestries. Furthermore, the ethical concerns around using genetic data and calculating relatedness are not considered. We present a projection-based approach that can efficiently and accurately estimate kinship. We implement our method using encryption-based techniques that provide provable security guarantees to protect genetic data while kinship statistics are computed among multiple sites.}",

Here, we propose distributed Mixed Effects Genome-wide Association study (dMEGA), a method that enables federated generalized linear mixed model-based association testing across multiple sites without explicitly sharing genotype and phenotype data. dMEGA employs a reference projection to correct for population-stratiﬁcation and utilizes efﬁcient local-gradient updates among sites, incorporating both ﬁxed and random effects. The accuracy and efﬁciency of dMEGA are demonstrated through simulated and real datasets. dMEGA is publicly available at https://github.com/Li-Wentao/dMEGA.},

    abstract = {Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. Evidently, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results. On another front, due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI), genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance, since sensitive data never leaves the local sites. Motivated by these, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements.},
