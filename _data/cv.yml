      institution: University of California San Diego, US
      year: 2019 - 2020
      description:
        - Developed two prediction models in R and Python (based on Logistic Regression) that can handle horizontally and vertically partitioned data, Grid Binary LOgistic REgression (GLORE) and VERTIcal Grid logistic regression (VERTIGO).
        - Proved and developed an algorithm that can transmit Confidence Intervals based on VERTIGO and published the method as VERTIGO-CI.
        - Set up Dockers for the prediction models (VERTIGO with Confidence Intervals & GLORE) and then tested the capability of privacy-preserving prediction with data from Oklahoma, Texas, and San Diego.
        - Cleaned correlated genetic data with Quality control (QC) procedure in Plink.
