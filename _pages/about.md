> "*Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.*" --- Winston Churchill, 1946

My name is Wentao (文韬 in Chinese), and I go with Winston. I am currently a PhD candidate and research assistant in the School of Biomedical Informatics at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). And I am advised by Dr. [Xiaoqian Jiang](http://xiaoqianjiang.weebly.com/) and Dr. [Arif Harmanci](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/arif-harmanci.htm).

Up to date, there are [over 380 million](https://www.hipaajournal.com/healthcare-data-breach-statistics/#:~:text=Between%202009%20and%202022%2C%205%2C150,population%20of%20the%20United%20States.) healthcare records breached, and for the value per stolen healthcare record is an average of [$363](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/data-breaches-in-the-healthcare-sector). Hence it is an urgent to protect the healthcare data from being hacked, while maintaining the data utility. My **research interest** is the intersection of privacy-preserving machine learning and Genomewide Association Studies (GWASs). I have developed several ___privacy-preserving GWAS___ algorithms with ___federated leraning___, ___secure multi-party computation___, ___homomorphic encryption___, and ___differential privacy___. Further details can be found in my current and previous [projects](/projects/).

With [over 380 million](https://www.hipaajournal.com/healthcare-data-breach-statistics/#:~:text=Between%202009%20and%202022%2C%205%2C150,population%20of%20the%20United%20States.) breached healthcare records and an average value of [$363](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/data-breaches-in-the-healthcare-sector) per stolen record, protecting healthcare data from hacking is crucial. I have developed multiple algorithms using ___privacy-preserving GWAS___ algorithms with ___federated leraning___, ___secure multi-party computation___, ___homomorphic encryption___, and ___differential privacy___ to ensure privacy in GWASs. These methods enable collaborative analysis without sharing raw data, preserve individual privacy, and prevent identification. Further details can be found in my current and previous [projects](/projects/). -->

Before pursuing my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Statistics from the University of California, San Diego, and a BSc in Mathematics from Shanghai Maritime University. For more details about my qualifications and experiences, please refer to my [CV](/cv/).
